# Project 2 : Programming for Data Analysis
***

### by John Loughnane - Student Number : G00388113


## Introduction: what this repository contains.
***
The repository is 'https://github.com/loughjo/ProgDataAnalysis-Project-2' and in there you will find ProgDataAnalysisProject2.ipynb which is the jupyter notebook for second Project in the module Programming for Data Analysis.


## Setup
***
I use a windows 10 laptop with python 3.7, CMDER and Anaconda installed. 
You can find Anaconda at the following website :
https://www.anaconda.com/

You can find Cmder at the website :
https://cmder.app/

You will need to pull the github repository https://github.com/loughjo/funddata-assessment/ down to your local machine.


## How to get the code running
***
Once cmder is started up you should be able to got to the directory path where you have downloaded the **funddata-assesment** repository

cd  funddata-assesment

In the funddata-assesment directory you will find the normal-distribution.ipynb and folder **exercises** which contains the jupyter notebooks for the assements.

From here you can run **jupyter notebook** which launches the Jupyter Notebook App. The notebook interface will appear in a new browser window or tab and you will see the normal-distribution.ipynb jupyter notebook, Readme file exercsise folder and datasets. 


## Running
***
Once a jupyter notebook is open you can go run the code or markdown cells.
Each Jupyter notebook has markdown cells and comments in the code cells to explain the code in the Project and assessments.
